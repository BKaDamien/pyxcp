pyXCP is a lightweight Python library which talks to ASAM MCD-1 XCP enabled devices.
These are mainly, but not only, automotive ECUs (Electronic Control Units).

XCP is used to take measurements, to adjust parameters, and to flash during the development process.

XCP also replaces the older CCP (CAN Calibration Protocol).
